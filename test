 Boot-Time Persistence (BootExecute):

The Simple Part: Modifying the BootExecute registry key to run an application before logon.

The Advanced Part:

Delayed Execution: Introduce a significant delay to your payload's execution to avoid early detection.

Pre-Logon Payload: Launch an intermediate application that sets up a more complex persistence after logon.

Driver Loading: Use BootExecute to load a malicious driver before the operating system has fully started.

System Recovery Prevention: Interfere with system recovery processes that happen at boot.


reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v "BootExecute" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "powershell.exe -enc <base64_encoded_payload>" /f



Using "AutoRun" INF Files:

The Simple Part: Autorun INF files were primarily used for CDs and USB drives.

The Slightly Less Obvious Part:

Local Drive Autorun: While AutoRun is disabled on most local drives, certain applications might still interact with INF files. You can still use it in some instances.

INF File Obfuscation: Create the INF file with a hidden name and make it a system file for stealth.

Action Execution: Use the open= key in the INF to trigger your payload, but also include some other legitimate action to obscure the intent.
